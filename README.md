# MorseCodeConverter

This is a simple java application that involves the conversion between English and morse code. The user can choose to either convert from English to morse code or vice versa.
All you need to do to use the program is to download the.jar executable file called morse_conversion_app and run it.

You can also copy the result and paste it anywhere you need to :)

How to write morse code:
1- You use dots for the short pulses and underscore for long ones.
2- Use a single space to seperate parts of a letter.
3- Use three spaces to seperate letters.
4- Use seven spaces to seperate words.

** Dots can be considered an english character or a morse code character.
